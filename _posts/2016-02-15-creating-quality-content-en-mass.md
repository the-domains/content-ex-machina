I've been producing content, in various forms, for the purpose of business storytelling for more than a decade. I've consulted for many companies on how to design and implement cost effective content strategies that stretch the budget without compromising quality.
In fact, I get questions so often about this that I decided this would make an excellent topic to write on. 

There are two sets of factors to keep in mind: Technical and Soft. 

Here are some of the key technical factors that one must consider to produce quality content cost-effectively:

* The planning stage is always cheaper than production or post production. 
* Once the production starts, the juice is running and it becomes a race against time and, subsequently, costs.
Most production people charge flat rates by half days or full days. The amount of work they do during that time is not a factor in their pricing models.

From a technical standpoint, it boils down the following equation:

**The total volume of content you can produce within a limited amount of time.** That is, the more content you're prepared to create in one sitting, the cheaper each individual piece of content becomes. 

With these technical factors in mind, the key soft factors are tied to producing compelling business stories. These originate from a few sources: _experts, thought leaders, and customers_. The most compelling stories from these sources typically manifest in the form of v_isions on the future of an industry, perspectives on competitive landscapes, case studies, anecdotes and personal experiences_.
